Thoughts on the content analysis

-distinguish the role of the user ID. Potential they could be:
* Initiator (the participants, who were identified thourhg the starter contribution)
* Follower (characterized by mainly so-called "reply of posts")
* role switcher (have both follower and initator characteristics)
